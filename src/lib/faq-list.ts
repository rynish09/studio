    question: "What is your 90-Day 2x Organic Revenue Guarantee?",
    answer: "We are confident in our ability to deliver transformative results. For qualifying partners, we guarantee to double your monthly revenue attributed to organic channels within our first 90 days of working together. This is a partnership built on a shared commitment to aggressive, measurable growth.",
    vip: true,
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if you don't achieve the 2x results in 90 days?",
    answer: "Our guarantee is a testament to our commitment. If we do not achieve the 2x organic revenue goal within the 90-day timeframe, we will continue to work for free—at the full scope of our engagement—until we do. Your success is our success, and we stand by that.",
    vip: true,
  },
  {
    question: "What exactly is a 'Custom Package'?",
    answer: "A Custom Package is a tailored 90-day strategic sprint designed for your specific goals. After our initial discovery call, we hand-pick a combination of our services (e.g., YouTube production, content repurposing, social media management) that will deliver the highest impact for your brand. It's not a one-size-fits-all solution; it's a bespoke partnership.",
    vip: true,
  },
  {
    question: "Who is this for? Do you work with new brands?",
    answer: "We partner best with established experts, founders, and consultants who already have a deep well of knowledge but lack the time or strategy to turn it into authority-building content. While we can work with newer brands, our process is most effective for those with a proven offer and a clear target audience.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between you and other content agencies?",
    answer: "We are a strategic partner, not a content mill. We don't just 'make content'; we build enterprise value. Our focus is on long-term authority and creating 'class content'—assets so valuable, they become a moat for your business. We are operators who have studied and applied the playbooks of the world's best.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will I have to shoot the video content myself?",
    answer: "Yes, and we've optimized this to be incredibly efficient for you. While you could hire a professional videographer, self-shooting is far more cost-effective and authentic. We provide you with an extensive, structured tutorial that covers everything—from camera settings and lighting to achieving perfect sound quality. We make it easy for you to record high-quality footage without the high cost and scheduling headaches of a film crew.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be on every social media platform?",
    answer: "No. We focus on dominating the one or two platforms where your target audience lives. We believe in depth over width. We help you choose the right channels and then execute with excellence, rather than spreading your brand thin across every platform.",
  },
  {
    question: "How involved do I need to be in the content creation process?",
    answer: "Your primary role is to be the expert. We handle the rest. Typically, our process involves a weekly or bi-weekly session where we extract your knowledge. From there, our team manages strategy, scripting, production, editing, and distribution. Your time is leveraged, not consumed.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't like the content you create?",
    answer: "Our process is built on collaboration. You have approval at key stages, from initial concepts to final edits. Our goal is to become an extension of your brand and voice, and we refine our approach based on your feedback to ensure we are perfectly aligned.",
