    question: "What exactly is a 'Custom Package'?",
    answer: "A Custom Package is a tailored 90-day strategic sprint designed for your specific goals. After our initial discovery call, we hand-pick a combination of our services (e.g., YouTube production, content repurposing, social media management) that will deliver the highest impact for your brand. It's not a one-size-fits-all solution; it's a bespoke partnership.",
    vip: true,
  },
  {
    question: "How do you determine pricing?",
    answer: "We don't offer cookie-cutter packages or pricing. Every partnership is unique, and so is our pricing structure. Your investment is determined by the specific services you need and the scope of our engagement. We'll build a detailed, transparent proposal for you following our initial strategy call, so you know exactly where your investment is going.",

    question: "What results can I expect in 90 days?",
    answer: "In 90 days, you can expect to have a powerful, repeatable content engine, a significant increase in brand authority and audience engagement, and a clear path to long-term organic growth. We focus on building foundational assets (like a strong YouTube presence) that deliver compounding returns over time, not just short-term vanity metrics.",
    vip: true,
  },
  {
    question: "Who is this for? Do you work with new brands?",
    answer: "We partner best with established experts, founders, and consultants who already have a deep well of knowledge but lack the time or strategy to turn it into authority-building content. While we can work with newer brands, our process is most effective for those with a proven offer and a clear target audience.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between you and other content agencies?",
    answer: "We are not a content mill. We are a strategic partner. We don't just 'make content'; we build enterprise value. Our focus is on long-term authority and creating 'class content'â€”assets so valuable, they become a moat for your business. We are operators who have studied and applied the playbooks of the world's best.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be on every social media platform?",
    answer: "No, and you shouldn't be. Our strategy focuses on dominating the one or two platforms where your target audience lives. We believe in depth over width. We help you choose the right channels and then execute with excellence, rather than spreading you thin across every platform.",
  },
  {
    question: "How involved do I need to be in the content creation process?",
    answer: "Your primary role is to be the expert. We handle the rest. Typically, our process involves a weekly or bi-weekly session where we extract your knowledge and ideas. From there, our team manages the strategy, scripting, production, editing, and distribution. Your time commitment is minimal, but your expertise is central.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't like the content you create?",
    answer: "Our entire process is built on collaboration and feedback. You will have approval at key stages of the content creation process, from the initial concepts to the final edits. Our goal is to become an extension of your brand and voice, and we refine our approach based on your feedback to ensure we're perfectly aligned.",
